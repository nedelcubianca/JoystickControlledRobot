# JoystickControlledRobot
 A robot built with analog electronics that avoids obstacles using sensors and can be manually controlled via a joystick. Combines autonomy and user input for interactive navigation. Ideal for learning robotics and analog circuits!

## About Me
Hello! My name is **Nedelcu Bianca Nicoleta**, and I am a second-year student at **Automation and Computer Science** within **UNSTPB**. I am passionate about electronics, robotics, and programming, and I love working on projects that combine hardware and software.

## About the Project
This project was developed as part of my **Analog Electronics** course. The goal was to create a robot capable of avoiding obstacles using sensors while also being controllable via a joystick. The project required knowledge of **analog electronics** for the hardware design and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** for the Arduino code.

### Key Features:
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: The robot uses ultrasonic sensors to detect and avoid obstacles autonomously.
- **Joystick Control**: The robot can also be manually controlled using a joystick, allowing for interactive navigation.
- **Analog Electronics**: The circuit design involves analog components such as sensors, motors, and signal processing.
- **Arduino Programming**: The code is written in C++ using OOP principles to ensure modularity and reusability.

### Technologies Used:
- **Hardware**: Arduino Uno, ultrasonic sensors, DC motors, motor driver, joystick module.
- **Software**: Arduino IDE, C++ with OOP concepts.
- **Tools**: Circuit simulation software (e.g. Tinkercad).

### What I Learned:
- Designing and implementing analog circuits for real-world applications.
- Integrating hardware and software to create a functional robotic system.
- Applying OOP principles to write clean and maintainable code.
- Problem-solving and debugging in both hardware and software domains.
